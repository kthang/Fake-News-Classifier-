# Fake-News-Classifier-
This is the final project for Machine Learning in R, a class by Sanjiv Das at Santa Clara University.  It was co-authored with Hariz Hisham, Qing Zhang, Thuy Le, and Tammy Nguyen.

The goal is to take in newspaper articles and uses machine learning methods to predict if the article belongs to a website with a high factual rating.  The factual labels came from https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/.       

This repo contains an ipynb that performed the scrapping (newspaper), the ipynb with model training (modeling_fake_news), and a PowerPoint that explains our methods and results (detecting_fake_news).
